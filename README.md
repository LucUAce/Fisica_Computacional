# Fisica_Computacional

Some Fortran subroutines I wrote for the "FÃ­sica Computacional" course at the Universitat de Barcelona, an elective course within the Physics minor of the Mathematics degree.

The subroutines are commented in (a mix of) Catalan and Spanish... And some of them were written for specific purposes, so they might require adjustments to improve modularity!
